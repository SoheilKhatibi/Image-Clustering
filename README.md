# Image-Clustering

## Introduction
[Unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning), which in my opinion is not being paid enough attention in comparison to its importance, is the type of machine learning algorithm that analyzes and explores the way to cluster unlabeled data. It can be utilized in plenty of use cases which can lead to high gain in terms of a variety of mentalities.

Here is an intuitive and fun implementation of [K-means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) and [Expectation–maximization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm) algorithms.

In this project, The task is to find the best k colors that can present a fully colored image.
